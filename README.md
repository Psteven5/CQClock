# CQClock
A Quine clock in C inspired by Tsoding's Quine clock in C adventure and viewer codecat69's inline asm include trick, which allows the source code to be smaller in size while still allowing renaming (as opposed to reading the file at runtime). It is unfortunately still not as small as the JS Quine clock by Martin Kleppe (@aemkei on X).
